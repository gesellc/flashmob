# Micro Retro

10.07.2020
'****' making behaviors more efficient (how to rotate)
'*' reducing waste
time window for rotation kept
'**' team starts to groove, flow is getting better and better!
focused on objective
we shared knowledge (automatic start of tests)
'**' take care that everybody has the same point of understanding (don't haste)
we really coded! Progress


from the olden times:

keep micro retros
* stay flexible
do not hesitate to improve your team mates
focus on a specific goal
call out next speaker according to list
stick to roles: driver only does what he/she has been told, navigator: stay mobber-aware
hold back - be empathic
make transition perfect
** start to code
mind closing time
driver: clearify immediately

# Goals

- [x] Get mob tool running for whole team
    - [ ] might be necessary to run git bash from windows cmd
- [x] Decide which problem to tackle
    -> A "Bio-Kiste" Helper that pre-fills the shopping cart or can be seen as a subscription

First Step:
 - understand the problem / task
    Target: website "Ã–ko Kiste"

    Near to implementation
       Fill Shopping Cart from existing reminder list
       Provide reminder (e.g. email, push notification, etc.) for triggering the order (fixed time in the week? reminder latest on Tuesday, order latest on Wednesdays, box gets delivered on Friday).
       
    Describing customer value
       Saving time
       Create fixed list only once
       Handle rarely needed items like get reminder to order milk every 3 weeks
       Keep very easy control over actual purchase by reviewing order


# Get mob tool & git working FGR:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Well, interesting. All my changes are gone... after mob start...
Guess they are on master branch...
=======
- I'm now on master branch, therefore lets try to push this change via GUI to master branch!
   - That just worked fine! No pwd or user name request
- Well, lets try this via git bash!
   - Not working well so far. I'm asked for user name and pwd again. More details see "Miro"
- Try help from stackOverflow regarding credential:
    - in git bash type: "git config --global credential.helper wincred"
    - Time to push again, this should ask once more for credential
       - It asked for credentials again
    - No lets try to push again and see if credentials are still required
       - "Ja sauber die Musi!" Success! no credentials asked for!
    - CONCLUTION: at least credential manager link was missing.
- It's time for mob start/mob next
    - Lets push current changes before "mob start"
    - It is working!
