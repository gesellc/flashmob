hold back - be empathic
make transition perfect
** start to code
mind closing time
driver: clearify immediately

# Goals

- [x] Get mob tool running for whole team
    - [ ] might be necessary to run git bash from windows cmd
- [x] Decide which problem to tackle
    -> A "Bio-Kiste" Helper that pre-fills the shopping cart or can be seen as a subscription

First Step:
 - understand the problem / task
    Target: website "Ã–ko Kiste"

    Near to implementation
       Fill Shopping Cart from existing reminder list
       Provide reminder (e.g. email, push notification, etc.) for triggering the order (fixed time in the week? reminder latest on Tuesday, order latest on Wednesdays, box gets delivered on Friday).
       
    Describing customer value
       Saving time
       Create fixed list only once
       Handle rarely needed items like get reminder to order milk every 3 weeks
       Keep very easy control over actual purchase by reviewing order


# Get mob tool & git working FGR:

- Well, interesting. All my changes are gone... after mob start...
Guess they are on master branch...
